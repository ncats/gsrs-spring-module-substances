#this will reuse maven dependencies so it doesn't redownload everytime

#  directories:
 #   - $HOME/.m2
#this overrides the default maven install which is run as part of the install phase we will run our mvn in script

  - ./installExtraJars.sh
  - ./mvnw -U clean install -DskipTests
# this is really dirty but there is so much output from these tests and turning off logging and sql isn't enough
# so I grep for ERROR lines which will show the test failures but that returns exit code of 0 if it finds a match so we want "not" that to fail the build if there are errors
  - ./mvnw -q test 2>/dev/null
